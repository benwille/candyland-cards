# Candyland Cards

Candyland Card deck for use with the Candyland board game.

## Description

My daughters love playing Candyland, but over the years we have ruined or lost a few of the cards. So I built this PWA that can be downloaded to your phone just like an app.

It builds the deck and shuffles.

See [coming soon](#coming-soon) section for features that are in progress or requested.
